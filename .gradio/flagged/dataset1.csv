Here's a breakdown of the plan:

**Estimated months to goal:** Based on your current weight and activity level, I estimate that it will take you approximately 2 months to reach your goal of losing 5 kg.

**Daily Exercise Plan:**

* Morning: Light Yoga (30 min) - This will help improve flexibility, balance, and strength.
* Evening: Short Walk (30 min) - This will help increase your overall physical activity level and burn some extra calories.

**Daily Meals:**

* Breakfast: Oatmeal with Fruits and Nuts (400 calories), Veggie Scrambled Eggs (200 calories)
	+ Tips: Start with a bowl of oatmeal cooked with milk and topped with fruits, nuts, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Add scrambled eggs made with spinach and mushrooms for extra protein.
* Lunch: Chana Masala with Whole Wheat Roti (550 calories), Mixed Greens Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette (100 calories)
	+ Tips: Choose whole wheat roti over regular roti to increase fiber intake. Add a side salad with mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and a light vinaigrette.
* Snack: Fresh Fruit (50 calories), Roasted Chickpeas with Herbs (100 calories)
	+ Tips: Reach for fresh fruits like apples, bananas, or berries as a quick snack. Alternatively, roast chickpeas with herbs like cumin, coriander, and chili powder for a crunchy snack.
* Dinner: Palak Paneer with Brown Rice (600 calories), Steamed Broccoli with Garlic Naan (200 calories)
	+ Tips: Choose brown rice over white rice to increase fiber intake. Add steamed broccoli as a side dish with garlic naan for extra nutrition.

Remember to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, and adjust your meals based on your personal preferences and dietary needs.",2025-07-05 14:47:25.940486
